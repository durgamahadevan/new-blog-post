# Order and Chaos

Why does everything seem so incredibly in order when I look at them to find an order and yet in chaos? 

Is it a delusion of the my mind that an object seems so perfect in degree and dimension? 

Who set the idea of perfection in me? Why does something seem perfect?

And yet the very same object seem so imperfect the other time?

Were the spaces and distances planned out so between objects or they are just dispersed in space randomly? 

If I and a brinjal are made of the same fundamental elements?  Then why their mere grouping gives birth to appearances so different? So were the elements of a brinjal planned to exist that way with the spaces and distances that they have or was it born out of just a chance? 

How can an object be so chaotic yet ordered? ðŸ˜‚
