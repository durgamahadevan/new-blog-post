# Meditation

Imagine a class of little students in a school who are asked to form a line and walk from their classroom to the assembly hall on their own.
They are small, so they are active, and some **hyperactive and talkative, noisy** and other adjectives opposite to disciplined, so their march down to the assembly hall will not be a very peaceful one.
Now, if we were to **assign a senior person** to monitor them during this journey of theirs, and also tell him specifically to not try to control them and just walk past them. What will happen?
Some may still make noise, some may still hit someone but this time the journey will be a more peaceful one. Because there is an **awareness among the children that someone is watching us and us getting caught could have implications**. 
Now replace the line of students with the **line of thoughts** in your mind and the senior person to be your awareness. 
It is how meditation works. It is like a **procession of thoughts with awareness watching over them, slowly the thoughts will quieten and subsequently disappear peacefully.**
