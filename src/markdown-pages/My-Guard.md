# My Guard

All that was needed was
A pat on the back
A reassuring smile
A sign that you believe in me
You believe my ability
If you had only said 
We'll see... We are in it together
We'll not leave this

I don't know who I expect this from
Mother? Father? Myself?
I do not know... But seldom have 
All of them shown this
If I had failed all I could  
Receive was tears and disappointment

Never have you said it's fine
They don't deserve you
We'll strive harder, give time
We know you can do this

Oh I needed it so much
All my life
Always
I'd give it immeasurably 
If someone asked me
Someone confided in me
And gave me all those
Great powers that you have had over me

I don't know what I am good at anymore
What can I do better than others
It always seems someone replacing me
Can do better than me

For some reason I want to start from the root
From zero
From nothing
And become my ultimate source of inspiration
Encourage myself
Want to know for once that
Yes I am worth of life
This life
I don't want to blame anyone
Anything any decision
And just start
Start 
Do what I want to do

Just need that one go ahead
Become my shield to the outer world
My guard
